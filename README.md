This is the code repository for [Hands-On Microsoft Access 2019[Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/hands-on-microsoft-access-2019-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Microsoft Access 2019 is an information management tool that stores information and, arguably, helps manage data more efficiently than other spreadsheet apps. It is an ideal and particularly useful tool for small-to-medium-sized (SME) businesses.

This will be a practical, beginner-level course with hands-on, real-world examples you can use as models for your own activities. Beginning with a quick introduction to an example Access database, you will cover the core concepts, interface, and terminology you need to get started. You will then master the key components of data query management; forms to help you view, add, edit, and even delete data in a controlled environment. Then, you will publish your data with the help of built-in reporting, and move on to work with RDBMS concepts relating to ‘joins’ and why they’re important. You’ll find out how to automate your Access database by creating and applying macros and learn about VBA programming and how it’s used with Access.

By the end of the course, you will be confident in your new skills in Microsoft Access 2019 to improve productivity, and data visualization.
